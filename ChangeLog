	* README.md, touch4/kernel/OtdTouchDriver.c: Solve ohci-hcd problems
	of AMD IWBs This commit solves ohci-hcd problems of AMD Interactive White
	Boards.  Driver works fine with ehci and xhci, but it fails to keep
	track of touching fingers when it comes to ohci. This commit solves
	this problem implementing a circular queue. Before this commit, the
	driver would get 64 bytes from usb_interrupt_msg and server daemon
	would get this 64-byte chunk through the read system call. By the
	help of a circular queue, the driver gets multiple of 64 bytes and
	sends a single 64-byte chunk to the server when it calls read system
	call.  Fix indentation style and format Update README.md
